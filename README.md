# House-Prices-Competition
Describes my solution to solve the house prices regression problem.

This project is implemented in python.Is it divided into 3 parts, a main file (main.py), a file with utilitarian functions (utils.py), and a template for the linear regression classifier (regression.py).

I also provide a theoretical report on why my choices.(see report.pdf).

Using this code, I got position 490 (top 11%) with a score of 0.11726.

I hope this project can help you.
