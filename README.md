# House-Prices-Competition
This project is about my solution to solve the house prices regression problem.

This project is implemented in python and it is divided into 3 parts: a main file (main.py), a file with utilitarian functions (utils.py), and a template for the linear regression classifier (regression.py).

I also provide a theoretical report about my choices. (see report.pdf).

Using this code, I've got position 490 (top 11%) with a score of 0.11726.

I hope this project can help you.
